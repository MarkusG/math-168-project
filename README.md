# Hi Michael!

Here's a quick overview of the repository:

* Delay_Data - Mark's work; taking GTFS static and realtime data and obtaining a list of stops and their average delay values
* GTFS_Static - Original GTFS static data from MBTA
* Parsers - Mark's work; processing the raw GTFS static/realtime data to get delay data
* Rapid_Transit_Lines - Mark's work; ordered station lists to build the network representation, as well as the scripts to get there
* Initial_Data_Exploration.ipynb - Bowen's work; initial exploration of the GTFS static data
* Network_Construction_Delay_Correlation_and_Modularity.ipynb - Everyone's work; Willie and Reuben wrote to code to turn ordered station lists into a network; Mark did the histograms for delay data and modularity plots; Reuben did delay/centrality correlation
* RLP_Influence_Analysis.ipynb - Reuben's and Bowen's work; weighting of edges with delay data and implementation/application of the RLP algorithm
